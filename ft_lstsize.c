#include "libft.h"
/* 
 * The `ft_lstsize` function counts the number of elements in a linked 
 * list. Here's how it works:
 *
 * 1. The function takes one argument: a pointer to the first element of 
 * the list `lst`.
 *
 * 2. Then the function initializes a counter `count` to 0. This counter 
 * will be used to count the elements of the list.
 *
 * 3. The function enters a `while` loop that continues as long as `lst` 
 * is not `NULL`. In each iteration of the loop, the counter `count` is 
 * incremented by 1, and `lst` is updated to point to the next element of 
 * the list (`lst = lst->next`).
 *
 * 4. When `lst` becomes `NULL`, this means we have reached the end of the 
 * list, and the loop ends.
 *
 * 5. Finally, the function returns the value of the counter `count`, 
 * which represents the number of elements in the list.
 */
int	ft_lstsize(t_list *lst)
{
	int		count;

	count = 0;

		lst = lst->next;
	}
	return (count);
}

/* 
 * In this line of code `lst = lst->next;`, we move to the next element 
 * of the linked list.
 *
 * `lst->next` accesses the `next` field of the current list element `lst`, 
 * which contains a pointer to the next element of the list.
 *
 * Then `lst = lst->next;` assigns this pointer to `lst`, thereby moving 
 * `lst` to the next element.
 *
 * This is typically used in a loop to traverse all elements of a linked list.
