/* 
 * The `ft_lstadd_front` function adds the element `new` at the beginning 
 * of the list `lst`.
 *
 * Here's how it works:
 *
 * 1. The function takes two arguments: a pointer to a pointer to the first 
 * element of the list `lst` and a pointer to the new element `new`.
 *
 * 2. If `lst` and `new` are not `NULL`, the function proceeds. Otherwise, 
 * it does nothing.
 *
 * 3. The function sets the `next` field of the new element `new` to the 
 * current first element of the list `lst`.
 *
 * 4. Then the function makes `new` the first element of the list `lst`, 
 * setting `*lst` to `new`.
 *
 * Thus, the new element is successfully added at the beginning of the list.
 * Here's how it works:
 * 1. `new` is a pointer to the new element that you want to add to the beginning of the list. `new->next` is the field in the `new` element that points to the next element in the list.
 *
 * 2. `lst` is a pointer to a pointer to the first element of the list. `*lst` dereferences `lst`, giving you the first element of the list.
 *
 * 3. `new->next = *lst;` sets the `next` field of the `new` element to point to the current first element of the list. This effectively inserts the `new` element at the beginning of the list.
